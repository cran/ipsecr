Title: Spatially Explicit Capture-Recapture by Inverse Prediction
Version: 1.2.0
Date: 2022-08-29
Description: Estimates the density of a spatially distributed animal population 
  sampled with an array of passive detectors, such as traps. Models incorporating 
  distance-dependent detection are fitted by simulation and inverse prediction 
  as proposed by Efford (2004) <doi:10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.13043.x>.
