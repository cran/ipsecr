Description: Estimates the density of a spatially distributed animal population sampled with an array of passive detectors, such as traps. Models incorporating distance-dependent detection are fitted by simulation and inverse prediction as proposed by Efford (2004) <doi:10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.13043.x>.
